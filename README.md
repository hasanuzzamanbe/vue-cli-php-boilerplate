## Vue-cli with PHP Boilerplate


#

### How to use:
* Just clone the repository and keep on your server directory (htdocs)
* run command $` npm i` to install node
* run command $` npm run watch` for development server
* then run project directory like:

  in xampp or wampp-  http://localhost/project

  Like laravel valet server: http://project.test

## Production:

Run command $`  npm run production`

Then you need only project directory to deploy.

All done  :)

## Some tips for beginners: 

>Already installed plugins (for more check package.json)
* element-ui

* vue-router

> working directory

* You can write anywhere as you need

* Don't use this <i>build</i> directory(` project/builds`) 

  cause this <i>build</i> directory is changed automatically when you change any vue file.

* Write code on project directory will be a good choice.
